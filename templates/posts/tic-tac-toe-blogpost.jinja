    <p> 
        The game runs on Flask server wrapped by socketio using Python socketio library. I used an apache server to reverse proxy to the flask server and 
        port forwarded it to the internet on www.ga-project1.duckdns.org.
        At this stage server doesn't create individual rooms and broadcast each message to all connected clients.
        When the games ends with a win or draw a restart page pops up. If one player presses the 'Restart' button, game restarts for both parties. 
        In addition everyone connected to the server can watch the game being played and send a message to the main screen.
